                    <div id="mainpara"><p>Randomness is vital for computer security, making possible secure encryption that allows people to communicate secretly even if an adversary sees all coded messages. Surprisingly, it even allows security to be maintained if the adversary also knows the key used to the encode the messages. </p>

                    <p>Often random numbers can be used to speed up algorithms. For example, the        fastest way we know to test whether a particular number is prime involves choosing random numbers. That can be helpful in math, computer science and cryptography, among other disciplines.</p>
                    
                    <p>Random numbers are also crucial to simulating very complex systems.</p>
 
                    <p>When dealing with the climate or the economy, for example, so many factors interact in so many ways that the equations involve millions of variables. Today’s computers are not powerful enough to handle all these unknowns. Modeling this complexity with random numbers simplifies the calculations, and still results in accurate simulations.</p>

                <div class="quotes">But it turns out some – even most – computer-generated “random” numbers aren’t actually random. </div>

                <div class="para_tech">
                <p>They can follow subtle patterns that can be observed over long periods of time, or over many instances of generating random numbers. For example, a simple random number generator could be built by timing the intervals between a user’s keystrokes. But the results would not really be random, because there are correlations and patterns in these timings, especially when looking at a large number of them.</p>
        

                <p>Using this sort of output – numbers that appear at first glance to be unrelated but which really follow a hidden pattern – can weaken polls’ accuracy and communication secrecy, and render those simulations useless. How can we obtain high-quality randomness, and what does this even mean?</p>

                    <p>When discussing single numbers, a random number is one that is drawn from a set of possible values, each of which is equally probable. In statistics, this is called a uniform distribution, because the distribution of probabilities for each number is uniform (i.e., the same) across the range of possible values. For example, a good (unloaded) die has the probability 1/6 of rolling a one, 1/6 of rolling a two and so on. </p>
                    
                    <p>Hence, the probability of each of the six numbers coming up is exactly the same, so we say any roll of our die has a uniform distribution. When discussing a sequence of random numbers, each number drawn must be statistically independent of the others. This means that drawing one value doesn't make that value less likely to occur again. This is exactly the case with our unloaded die: If you roll a six, that doesn't mean the chance of rolling another six changes.</p>
